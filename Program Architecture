# What kind of system are we working with: 
 1. Non-Linear 
 2. Minimum Delay 
 3. Closed Loop System
 4. Requirements: Reduce Windup Error, Cascading PID Control, Variant Subsystem Heirarchy
#

# PID Values Calculation:
  P --> 
  I --> 
  D -->
#

# Pre-Launch Requirements
  1. Check Communication with Flight Computer
  2. Check that there is power to all components
  3. Sensors are fucntioning 
  4. Launch Commands cued
#

# Powered Flight
  1. Sensor Feedback: altitude, velocity, acceleration 
  2. PID Tuning based on wind + other disturbances
#

# Parachute Flight
  1. Determining Statement that deploys parachute
  2. Sensors used to determine it's descent path + potential landing point
